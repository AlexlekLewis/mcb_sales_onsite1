6. Warranty
The width : drop ratio must be 1:3. Any longer drops will not be covered under warranty
If the blind ordered is wider than the fabric roll width, it must be railroaded(turn around). Railroading 
of fabric voids the warranty. This often causes curling or cupping on the sides of the blind. We do 
not guarantee that this will go away entirely over time so please make your customer aware. Also, if 
the drop of the blind ordered is longer than the railroaded fabric width, it will be joined. The join is 
sewn and therefore light pinholes may appear across this join.
Minimum blind width for a chain operated blind is 150mm. The maximum blind width we recommend 
is 3000mm. Any sizes larger than the recommended width will not be covered under warranty.
GENERAL INFO - ROLLER BLINDS 
All our roller blinds will be manufactured in width as outside to outside of the bracket measurement. 
If you specify a recess fit, you need to make the required allowance and the blind will be made  
accordingly. The width you provide will be outside of bracket to the outside of bracket.
Unless otherwise specified on your order, all blinds will be made as standard or back roll, also known 
as under roll. This means the fabric is coming off the back of the roller closest to the window. 
All blinds come standard with chain control and metal chain.  Plastic chains are also available at no 
extra cost. Available chain control colours are White, Sandstone, Grey and Black.

WARRANTY
Important information for you and your customer
Fabric “V”ING
Patterns
Railroading and Cupping
Light Gaps
Fabric Joins
Puckering
Some roller blind sizes may require fabric to be joined. Depending on the fabric 
and type of join used, this may result in either visible pinholes through the join, or a 
solid band across the width of the join. Please refer to the CWSB pricelist for 
specific details of fabric joins.
Some wider width roller blinds will exhibit a deviation across the width of the fabric 
at the base rail. 
Large width roller blinds larger than 2400mm and/or drop longer than 2400mm, 
could show the effect of “V’ing. This effect is predominant on all large blinds. To 
reduce this effect, consider splitting the blind into smaller widths and/or multi-
linking blinds together. Roller blinds with a 3:1 size ratio, i.e. drop should not be 3x 
longer than the width due to potential fabric cupping and tracking may be void of 
warranty.
Textured or directional fabrics may not have the warp (vertical) or weft (horizontal) 
yarns travelling perfectly perpendicular to each other. Some deviation from the 
pattern or texture will exist. You should expect to see variations of up to 30mm in 
the direction of the pattern from one side of the blind to the other.
Selected fabrics can be railroaded. Railroading fabric often leads to curling or 
cupping of the outer edges of the blind. Railroading of the fabric changes the 
appearance of the blind, which is more pronounced in textured fabrics. Cupping of 
fabric at the outer edges of the blind is more pronounced on wider width roller 
blinds. 
All roller blinds allow light to pass around the sides of the fabric (even when 
blockout fabric is used). This is because the overall width of the blind including its 
brackets is always wider than the fabric width. Light Gaps are most prominent 
when a blind is fitted inside a window recess. Face fitting may be a better option 
than reveal fitting, however, the only way that light gaps can truly be minimised is 
to use hardware systems that utilise side channels.

ROMAN BLINDS
Standard Features 
Roman blinds come standard with cord,cleat, pulley and brackets ready for hanging. If the blind requires more 
than one width of fabric, the blind will be made with a full width centre panel and smaller pattern matched 
panels on either side. Heavy duty cord lock and Chain drive are optional. 
If the romans are side by side with the same drop, the panels will be equal and lineup. If the side by side 
Romans have different drops, the panels will not be equal or line up. Line-up of side by side Romans have a 
maximum tolerance of +/- 5mm.
All roman blinds settle after installation. The type of fabric, its weight and size of the blind will affect the extent 
to which the blind settles out. As this is unpredictable, the final drop may vary by up to 20mm.
Roman blinds need an operation clearance around the sides and top of the blind. This will allow light to pass 
around the sides of the blind. To reduce this effect, consider making the blind wider than it needs to be when 
face fitting.
Measurements
Please make sure that all measurements are finished sizes. We will not make any deductions. Batten spacing 
will vary depending on the drop of the blind. We manufacture blinds with Even panel spacing and do not cut 
corners by varying the bottom panel.
Please note that we do not recommend recess fit for Roman Blinds, due to the fact that the blinds drop by as 
much as 20mm.
Fabrics
All care is taken to identify flaws in fabrics. However, we request that all customer supplied fabric is checked by 
your store before sending to Creative Wholesale Blinds. We will not take responsibility for faulty fabric that has 
been cut.
Customer supplied fabric must be clearly marked with face and direction. If the fabric has not been marked 
then it will be cut at our discretion and we will take no responsibility.
Check and Stripe fabrics can be off grain, please keep this in mind when ordering. We do not take any 
responsibility for fabric that is off grain. Horizontal stripes are not recommended.
Swag Base Fabric Allowance – Extra 800mm To Drop
Heavy duty cord lock- $20 each
Headboard – 42mm or 65mm MDF add $12 per meter.
Returns
Where a remake of the product is requested, it will be invoiced at the listed price. Upon return of the faulty 
product, a credit will be issued if established to be a Creative Wholesale Blinds error.
If for any reason the blind has to be returned to our factory, we ask that it be repacked and returned in the 
same way that it left our factory.
All warranty claims must be returned to our factory for inspection.
