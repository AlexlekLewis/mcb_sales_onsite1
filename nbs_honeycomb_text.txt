Honeycomb Control Systems.  You have a choice between the Classic System, Easy Rise System 
the Cordless System, and AMP motorised.  The Classic System has a constant cord length to avoid 
long, dangling cords. The Easy Rise system has an endless cord system(which must be used with a 
cord tensioner), with a geared clutch, for a light and smooth operation.  The Cordless system has no 
visible cords, for a clean uncluttered look that can be raised and lowered from the bottom bar.  Lastly 
the AMP motorized system that can be powered by batteries or an 18v transformer.  Please add 
$52.76 for an extendable pole to operate the cordless system if required. 
4. 
Honeycomb Sizes.  Minimum Blind width for all systems excluding AMP is 200mm. The maximum 
blind width we manufacture, recommend and warrantee is 3660mm with the (Classic & Easy Rise 
systems) & 3040mm with the Cordless system.  The maximum blind drop is 2140mm for the Cordless, 
3040mm for the Easy Rise and Classic. Please refer to the Limitations Chart for more detailed 
information. 
5. 
Fabrics.  All our available fabrics are made from either non-woven or woven polyester that will not fray 
or fade.  We recommend and use only the Turnils range of 20mm single cell and 20mm Double cell 
construction.  There are 8 Fabric ranges to choose from within the Turnils Arena Honeycomb Shades 
swatch which is available through NBS.  The range has single and double cell fabrics in Semisheer, 
Translucent and Blockout.   
6. 
Headrail and Bottom Rail. There are Eight(9) colours for both Headrail and Bottom rail in 20mm 
expect for SKYLIGHT blinds(Aspen White only). These are Black, Grey Pail, Imagine Clay, Lucia Blue, 
Mimosa, Moonlight Snow, White Feather, Gray Flannel & Dove Grey.  This headrail has a smooth 
profile and no longer accommodates a slat insert on the front.
7. 
Safety.  Each blind is supplied with a cord tensioning device which is designed to tension the cord in 
compliance with child safe regulations and is crucial in allowing the blind to operate correctly.

Child Safety
With child safety an important consideration, you can put 
your mind at ease knowing there are a variety of solutions 
available in the Arena range. 
For the ultimate child safe solution select a cordless operating system such 
as our Cordless, Lift & Lock or Momenta systems which feature no loose 
operating cords. 
For more information on these systems see our ‘control options’ on page 14.
Child Safety Tips 
Make it safety first around your windows by always ensuring:
•	 Items that a child could climb on are away from 
windows that have cords or chains. This also includes 
placing cots, beds and chairs away from windows.
•	 Cords are secured as installed by looping around the 
cord cleat at all times.
All Arena corded window coverings come with child safety operation warning 
tags and safety cord cleats for holding operating cords.

When selecting the right fabric for your 
space, remember to consider:
Do the blinds need 
to provide a high 
level of insulation?
Will the blinds be a focal point 
in your space or coordinate 
with your furnishings?
How much light 
do you want to 
filter in?
